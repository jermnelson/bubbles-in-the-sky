# Bubbles in the Cloud

I float in the Colorado blue sky. North April wind chills the membrane, not me. Atmosphere filters through, 
removing carcinogenic particles and suspicious biologicals while buoying my 140 kilo mass above the rusty cliffs. 
A robin flirted in the aspen trees below, occasionally snapping her beak up towards me. I don't pretend the 
robin cares about the faint milky sphere with a spread-eagle human looking down. 

Direction, elevation, and gas equilibrium were controlled through my cell-phone's wireless connection.
The bubble's membrane expands and contracts through a biochemical neural network fused with spider and shell-fish 
based mucus DNA. A cross section of the membrane would show it not be a continuous mass, but different layers of 
inter-connected spheres. 

Some of these spheres held Hydrogen, countering the pull of gravity. The complexity of controlling the multitude 
of variables processed with the embedded nano-switches within the biological factories back at the my classic 02021 Toyota 
Prisus. I reflect on how I can float and not care about the stark death facing me if all of these complex systems failed, a 
failure of cascading chaos rippling upwards to the human scale. I'm not worried. Such silicon and carbon systems evolving 
new paths augmenting by human intelligence and intention.

I am not an engineer, merely an average project manager. 
 
My last project was really my last. I am now famous and despised by a significant minority of reactionaries. They have 
build a large fetish of the technology I made obsolete, redirecting their hate towards me and my friend, the late Dr. 
Hanover Huo. 

Ten years ago I worked for a small, free-lance software-as-service consulting company based in Chicago with offices in 
Bangalore and Shanghai. I flew from O'Hare and Mexico City every two or three weeks, working on a Mexican-American 
integration project started in aftermath of Trump's second term. With the genetic manipulation laws and ethics being 
more rational and relaxed in Mexico after the Robert Kennidy's biotechnology purge of California, my sub-project was 
managing required better software communication between  the production faculties in Tijuana and the San San Francisco and
San Diego research centers of our client. 

Our client's name is unimportant now, being bought out by a top 100 Wall Street pharmaceutical giant a few months after 
our involvement.

I spent much of my time in meetings; Zoom virtual and the rare in-person visits during pandemic wanes. 
Slides, 2 and 3-D holographic projections, our fine-tuned Generative Large Langauge Models.  Lying, negotiating, 
sleeping, dining out, and flying. 

My project was secondary to the chief project. My deliverables  were part real, coded by our engineers in China and India, 
and part bull-shit, both upstream to the managers of our clients and home office, and downstream to the engineers. This work paid 
for my condo on the North side, easily within walking distance of the Lake Michigan and Grant Park. When I was home, I slept, did 
laundry, and went out with my few remaining friends. I claimed I was too busy for a relationship, but that wasn't entirely true. 
I was depressed.

Dr. Huo and I met when I was in a project lull. My production schedule chugged on, I left for a trip to China in a couple of 
weeks and I wanted to catch-up on my domestic tasks before then. I walked outside in the oppressive Summer humidity of the Midwest,
went to a coffee shop dressed in my beat-up jean shorts and a faded blue t-shirt with my brown Birkenstocks. I ordered an iced 
coffee and sat down a table facing the street. I don't remember the name of the coffee shop, although I know it wasn't a chain. 

I zoned out, thinking about the multi-dimensional Ganett chart that keep track of my current project. Two days ago I heard from 
the gossip mill in the main office, that we close to signing another major client and I was excited. A small, middle-aged Asian 
man, with balding black hair, slightly sloped over, interrupted my revue.

"Hello, can I sit next to you?" he asked with a neutral accent. Definitely second or third generation American but what do I know.

"Sure, please sit.‚Äù I replied. I didn't want to be rude. He sat down across from me. He had an Italian Soda in a plastic cup with 
beads of water running down the outside as the ice melted in the cup. I looked away and  out the window.

"Humid weather we are having."

"Yeah, I'm headed to China in a couple of weeks and I expect I'll wish for Chicago's weather." I thought would be the end of our 
conservation.

"Do you know anything about dampening molecular  engineering?" I wasn't sure I wanted to answer I figured on some type of nano-technology 
but I couldn't be sure.

"Umm, no. Is a type of nano-technology?" I said back in tone that superseded just causal morning indifference.

"Yes, my research looks at using carbon fullerene or tiny buckyballs, to encapsulate molecules we want to disrupt, like gunpowder 
or other type of explosive charge. I've been looking for someone to help figure out the production schedule and help me bring it market."

I thought this person to be strange. How did he know I could help him? Could I help him? Although I liked my job, I was looking for a 
new challenge and helping one global corporation move electronic bits from one place to another with less friction, ignoring and 
circumventing local and global laws to the best effect. 

Global interference, enriching the small elites in every country. I didn't consider myself as a member of the elite; although my 
lifestyle and assets put me in the top ten percent of the planet.

I sent Dr. Huo my contact info through my real-world business card, embedded with server that along with the RFID chip, provides a 
public key to uniquely encrypt the receiver's information with my contact manger hosted by the Google-Apple consortium. 

My iPhone and watch with built in RFID scanner. Dr. Huo stared intently as I left the coffee shop.  

I didn't hear or think about Dr. Huo after I flew to Shanghai. Our deadline approached and the deliverables changed. My Mandarain 
improved as I sat and helped test and debug our code base. Testing across multiple virtual machines and 
operating systems; mapping our requirements through to LLMs that together with neurosymbolic AI compliers, converted data and 
extrapolating trends for our client.

I sat down. The smell of the city's pollution seeped through the best efforts of the climate controls of the boring box building 
in an industrial park in a Shanghai suburb. In Chicago, the day was just beginning and I was waiting to chat and Zoom conference call 
with a couple of the firm's partners. My iPhone beeped the message signal. I connected my plasma display to the universal output 
port on my cell-phone. The workstation's Microsoft OS image disappeared as the cell phone's Apple logo was displayed. 
A message was waiting from Dr. Huo.

I opened up the message, the body contained two short paragraphs. After scanning the first three sentences of pleasantries, Dr. Huo 
provided an [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) preprint he had recently written on carbon-neutral bucky-balls, combining to make certain 
configurations of explosive chemical reactions inert. I clicked on the hyper-link which took me to an PDF file of the paper. I 
downloaded the copy to my iPhone and then replied in the affirmative to Dr. Huo's request for meeting the Tuesday after I returned to Chicago.

I scanned through the remaining messages on my phone, replying to some, ignoring others, deleting the spam and other junk mail. I unplugged 
the cable from my cell-phone to the plasma display and let the wireless Microsoft client OS take charge. For many years now I assume that 
all of my electronic communications are monitored in some fashion by domestic and foreign governments, clients and competitors, and 
likely my own firm. I wasn't too surprised when I finished my work day and I was walking back to my room that the desk clerk told me I had visitors.

The door to my room was open when I arrived. Two taller Chinese dressed in dark suits and ties were waiting for me, parents clearly 
beneficiaries of higher protein diets. The smaller of the two stepped forwarded and smiled. He extended his right hand and asked, 

"How are sir, can we talk? My name is Chen Yui Yang my partner and I would like to discuss something delicate with you." His English 
excellent with just a trace of an accent.

I nodded my assent and I walked into the room and shut the door before turning around and shaking Chen's hand. I walked over to the 
single bed and sat down. 

"What can I do for you?" I asked. I wasn't sure who these men worked for, I assume either Chinese government or private 
contractor. My guess would be government as their suits had that odd stiffness of cheap nano-fiber projectile projection. 
Most contractors could afford the better quality and make of personal protection.

"I apologize for my associates quietness, he understand much more English then he speaks. Now, what can you 
tell of use Dr. Huo?"

I didn't know if I believed how incapable the associate's language skills were and I was surprised that my limited 
contact with Dr. Huo caused such an overt response from the authorities here in Shanghai.

"My contact with Dr. Huo has been limited. I just recently met the man and I agreed to help him out with some technology 
planning. I am meeting with him next week." I replied directly at Chen and also noticing how the other man followed my speech.

Chen said something in rapid-fire Chinese with the other agent replying in a lower tone. I wasn't sure what happened 
but Chen looked somewhat relieved as he turned back to me. 

"Please excuse us, but we are from a advisory body with the Central Government's nano-technology overseer committee. Dr. 
Huo's work shows great promise and we would like to assist you in any way we can. We are here to help if you or Dr. Huo 
need manufacturing assets." Chen then handed me a smart business card, shook my hand, motioned to the other agent, and 
left room by opening the door and walking out.

I didn't know what to think anymore. Being approached by the Chinese government is not an everyday occurrence. I knew 
that this personal contact would be reported back to various interested parties in the United States and I would be 
visited by others when I got back to the States.

My flight was scheduled to leave in a forty-two hours, I decided on some quick sight-seeing before leaving back to 
the states. I visited the World War II and Cultural Revolution monuments, purchased some illegal High-Def DVDs of 
recent Bollywood movie hits and went back to my hotel room after a traditional simple dinner of rice and fish sauce 
with cheap beer before collapsing into a deary night sleep.

As I left my hotel the next morning, hailing a cab, I caught out of the corner of my eye, a Mazda dark sedan idling 
about fifty meters from where I was standing. Inside were three men and I was sure the front passenger-side man was my friend Chen. He smiled and waved. A cab came and I got in. As we drove off I watched the Mazda swing out into traffic and start following us. When we got the airport, I mumbled through the transaction with the cab driver, him in broken English, me in my few phrases of Mandarin. I lost sight of the Mazda but I didn't care, I was running late for my flight and I still had to go through customs and check in my luggage.
	I fought my way through customs, my DVDs, not being the latest Hollywood fare was ignored, but I did endure a short interview about who I contacted and talked with during my stay in China. I didn't mention Chen, not wanting to get caught up in any inter-governmental snafu between the customs and who-knows-who that Chen represented. Finally, I am on the airplane, waiting for takeoff, sipping a cold can of Budweiser (the only cheap choice unfortunately, I wasn't flying first class on my Pacific journey, just Business)
	After a ten hour lay-over at Honolulu International airport, I was five hours from landing at O'Hara. The main deliverables for the current project are done. I am tired and plan to take a few days off, spend some time in researching nanotech and meeting with Dr. Huo.
	
Chapter One
	Mid-summer in a globally warmed Chicago melted the streets, drawing water vapor from Lake Michigan. The morning sun blocked by the horizontal blinds behind the passive-solar windows of my bedroom. My cell-phone vibrated insistently. Time to move and begin the day. Lunch with Dr. Huo, after that to the main library branch for more research and project planning, and finally back to the corporate offices for a maintenance meeting between Mexico, China, San Diego, and India.
	Our participation was coming to a close. The Mexican clinics now accepted a seamless income stream from Northern clients needing genetic enhancement and alteration. We were also looking at reverse business from the Chinese and Indian middle classes. With continent-wide universal health-care in North America, we could also expect income streams from Latin America.
	I got up and after finishing my morning hygiene dressed and prepared for my day. My condo was cool, thankfully I could afford air conditioning. Back in my early post-college career, I bought into a Lake Michigan renewal energy coop. From a battery of wind turbines twenty kilometers out in the lake, enough positive power credits allow my energy greedy. I try to keep my carbon footprint lower through reduction possession of physical objects. My archaic conditioning from growing up under privileged white early twenty-first century primary, secondary, and higher education institutions.
	My parents, both highly-paid legal and medical professionals, give me enough of an advantage that was I able to now live better with less resources then most billions of people.
	I closed my front door. I heard the door's security layers slide into place. My security at the time was not the best. I really didn't have much physical objects worth stealing. More worrisome was the threat of random violence from global warming refugees filling the city. Floating rafts of humanity floated through the now clear Arctic  ocean, down through the St. Laurence channel into the Great Lakes. The U.S. Coast Guard contained as many of the rafts in the Lake as they could. Current estimates of two million refugees floating out in the lake was hard to think about. They were creating their ecology, alternating between floating masses of algae that provided raw food to their food supply. Of course, smuggling humans continued to Chicago strained city resources.
	Violence and chaos erupted when many refugees fought for recognition and clashed with police and the suburb militias. Most of the casualties were silent, people ending up erased through biological and electronic conflict. I avoided areas of question, finding the answers through my collection of four-dimensional mapping and predictive Google web services. All pumped into my cell phone.
	I still had an hour before lunch so I walked down the alley to  Irving and then begin walking North. Hybrid vehicles of various colors and sizes passed by as I walked on the thermo-cement refinished sidewalks. My shoe soles adjusted under my feet, cooling and keeping my internal temperature from reacting too much from the hot Illinois day.
